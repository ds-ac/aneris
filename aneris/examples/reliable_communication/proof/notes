Acknowledgement does not strictly need to carry evidence of received msg:
- We might want to add assertion on it, to more strongly guarantee that communication more well-behaved.
- NB: CANNOT send evidence of `Rs i` AT ALL, as it is only generated when user-land commits to receiving
  + INSTEAD, evidence of `ackId` might be sent.


Sequence ID does not necessarily have to live in "canonical send/receive".
- Alternative to ID'd messages would be a queue of messages where the ID can be
computed based on the Sequence ID LB, and the position in the queue.

Sequence ID upper bound is not needed.
